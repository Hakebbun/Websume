>    I'm a huge fan of card games. I play a ton of Magic the Gathering, have relatively recently been playing more and more Android: Netrunner, and of course a whole lot of Hearthstone. While I enjoy dabbling in the deck building of constructed formats, my heart lies in the wide world of limited formats. Today I'd like to talk about Hearthstone's Arena.

  Let me start by offering that I love playing Hearthstone's Arena mode. I think that drafting a deck of cards asynchronously from other players is a hugely intelligent move given the 'ad-hoc' play pattern Blizzard is expecting from players. The number of other online card games that have adopted this system for their own limited environment really speaks to its intelligence.  The other innovation that Blizzard brought to Hearthstone is the drafting of your class <i>before</i> drafting your deck. This allows the designers to show the player only cards that that player can actually play in their draft deck, which in turn makes each pick feel like a bigger deal to the player.

  There is however, a question that's been bouncing around in my head regarding Hearthstone's draft mode: what are the long term implications of having a draft pool the size of an eternal format?

  In Magic the Gathering (MTG from here on out) there's a concept of a <i>limited environment</i>; the card pool from which players draft cards is a carefully design subset of cards that rotates. Noteably, the rotation means that the size of the limited format does not grow infinitely. This is in contrast to the <i>eternal formats</i> who's card pool will only increase over time.

  As a brief aside, I promise that I won't spend too much time comparing Hearthstone and MTG. While there's a lot to be learned via the comparison, the sheer age of MTG makes most direct comparisons less useful than I'd like.

  Back to the Arena!

  The Arena is a limited format; players are limited in their deck building by the 90 cards that they are shown while drafting. However in some sense, Arena is also an eternal format since the wider card pool that their choices come from is inclusive to every card in Hearthstone's history (with a few exceptions). This is could become a problem for a few reasons.

  The first is the loss of the capacity to philosophically pivot card design, which ultimately limits the game's design space.

  ...

  That was wordier than I expected it to be. Think about it this way: the current rate on a minion with cost M is to have attack and health M/M+1. We see this with most releases of new cards. If, for whatever reason, Blizzard decides to change this accepted rate in either direction, we would be left with a whole pile of cards that adhere to an entirely different power curve. Now, shifting philosophies like this isn't common, nor is it always a healthy thing for a game. However, the <i>inability</i> for a designer to even consider making a change in their philosophies can be severely restricting. There exists a world where the health of a format requires a bump up or down in a set of cards' general power levels, and it would be dangerous to restric one's design space that does not allow for such pivoting.

  The second problem is the tendency to converge on stats over synergy. The value of powerful synergy cards in arena is vastly diminshed because of the strong likelihood of never seeing enough good cards that synergise with them. Think about how frequently any of the "dragons matter" cards have come up in your own Arena drafts and consider how frequently you pass over them. Then, rather than drafting interesting synergies, the player is encouraged to draft cards based solely on that card's stats. This problem is only exacerbated as more cards are added to the card pool since the probability of hitting pairs of synergy cards only decreases.

  Interestingly this problem still can't be solved even by returning to themes since each theme is parasitic to one another; the more mech synergies introduced to the card pool, the lower the percentage of dragon synergies.

  So what's the solution here?

  The most obvious solution is to just introduce more formats. Similar to constructed formats where players can choose between Wild (all cards are legal) and Standard (cards from the X most recent sets are legal). We could conceivably have a "Wild Arena" and a "Standard Arena" but the cost of splitting a game mode into sub-modes is a split in your player base: If you move half of your players from one game mode to another game mode, then each group now has half the number of people to play with. Luckily, the problem is offset once your player base is large enough. To be hyperbolic for a moment, dividing infinity by 2 still results in infinity.

  So I think it will ultimately result in a waiting game. I'm absoutely sure that Blizzard and Ben Brode (Hearthstone's lead designer) are aware of the long-term issues that the Arena presents. It is my prediction then, that they are playing a waiting game: as their player base increases, and the number of cards in the arena card pool is not yet unhealthy, then they can afford to keep a united player-base.

  I'm very interested to see what direction Blizzard takes the limited format for Hearthstone - there are plenty of pitfalls and they're arguably the trailblazers for digital card games. I hope I gave you something interesting to think about, or at least sparked some interest in the long-term planning for online games.
